$1 :-$ Write a Python program to count the number of elements in a list within a specified range. Go to the editor.

def count(list1, l, r): 
      
    # x for x in list1 is same as traversal in the list 
    # the if condition checks for the number of numbers in the range  
    # l to r  
    # the return is stored in a list 
    # whose length is the answer 
    return len(list(x for x in list1 if l <= x <= r)) 
  
# driver code 
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 40, 40, 60, 70] 
l = 40
r = 80 
print (count(list1, l, r) )
